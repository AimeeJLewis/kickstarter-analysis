# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns  
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to compare how different campaigns fared to Louise's play, 'Fever', in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
A line graph was created from a pivot table by filtering down to "theater" under the Parent Category and showcasing the outcomes of all theater campaigns - successful, failed, and canceled which were then broken down by each month.

Based on the Outcomes by Launch Date, the greatest number of theater campaigns were launched May, June and July while the least number of campaigns were launched November and December.  However, if you look at the success rate percentage of the campaigns by month there wasn't a huge discrepency in the success rate percentage based on any month, just the number of campaigns that were launched. May did have the highest success rate percentage at about 67% though followed closely by June at a 65% success rate.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
A line graph was created based on the percentage of successful, failed and canceled theater campaigns broken down by a set goal range. These numbers were derived from calculating the number of successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns using the COUNTIFS function for each goal range and finding the percentages of each based on the total number of campaigns for each range.

The most successful theater campaigns had pledge goals of less than $5,000, which out of the total campaigns, the campaigns that fell below the $5,000 pledge goal accounted for over 50% of the total campaigns that were analyzed.  Those campaigns had over a 70% success rate of reaching their goal. Even the campaigns that had a goal of $5,000 to $9,999 saw only about a 55% success rate of meeting their goal. Overall, the lower the campaign goal, the higher success rate/lower failed rate of the campaign.  The higher the campaign goal, the lower success rate/higher failed rate we see. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encoutered

## Limitations
One of the limitations that we have with this data, is the timeframe on which we are analyzing...the most recent campaign was in 2017.  We should have more recent data to trend more current campaigns to help give Louise better insight. Another limitation we have is how each campaign goes about collecting and asking for pledges which could be another recommendation that we could give Louise on how to make sure her campaign is successful.  We can recommend a goal amount that she should request, but not how she should go about asking for those pledges.
## Recomendations
We could create another chart showing the length of each campaign launch date to their deadline to give Louise a timeframe on how long she should run her campaign to increase her changes of it being successful.  We could also look at the average donation on successful campaigns so she should hope to receive from each backer.
